    <h2>ABOUT THE BOOK</h2>
<img class="Family_First_Art" src="wp-content/themes/familyfirstbook/assets/images/Family_First_Art.jpg" />

    <p><b>“If Jesus Christ were sitting at your dinner table, observing you as a father and a husband, would you be proud of your behavior?”</b></p>
    <p>
This is the question Curtis asked himself eighteen months ago and the honest answer was, “No.” In this powerful book, Curtis reflects on what it means to raise children in the way of the Lord and how husbands can and should support and honor their wives as the role models of warmth, compassion, and love.

    <p>“Curtis Estes is successful in the financial sense, but what about his family? His book, Family First, chronicles another aspect of his life, as he comes to realize there is something more important than living the comfortable American life. His transparent and forthright efforts to become a humble husband and proactive father will inspire you. I am grateful to know Curtis and to support his new discovery.”
